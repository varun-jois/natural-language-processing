Harold Sakata is also really good as Oddjob, Goldfinger's hat-slinging mute Korean manservant. Honor Blackman is a fine Pussy. Shirley Eaton is good fun as Jill. Tania Mallet is not quite as good, as Jill's vengeful sister Tilly, but does OK.Guy Hamilton's first (and easily best) effort as director set the standard for the series for many years to come, introducing an overall jokier tone than the previous two, most obviously in Bond's affectionate needling of the grouchy Q.The score is one of John Barry's best (for me, it's second only to OHMSS), and the Shirley Bassey theme song has rightfully become a classic.Overall, this is still probably the best Bond movie ever made.\"},\n",

This is also the first Bond film to feature a cold opening, as we get to see Bond on the tail end of one adventure, only to jump into another. And what a great cold opening it is! It establishes early that this will be an action-packed film.And indeed, \"Goldfinger\" features some great action scenes, with Sean Connery handling himself with as much charm and cool as ever. Opposite Connery are Bond\\'s first, truly iconic villain and henchman in the forms of Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Fr�be) and Oddjob (Harold Sakata), and his first, truly iconic Bond girl, Pussy Galore (played by Honor Blackman). They too help contribute to the iconicity of this film and this franchise.\"Goldfinger\" is such a fun film, full of twists and turns! This is golden age Bond at its finest - pardon the pun.'},\n",

       "   'review': \"  Bond is a bit of a whore isn't he? I know he can escape danger, but there's a difference between having swag, and trying to get every girl in bed, including your assassins and enemies. Come to think of it, Bond doesn't really have much character outside of the 'swag' idea. However he does have his moments and it's always enjoyable to see a person outsmart his enemies instead of outfight them. I also like how Bond keeps on getting into trouble, especially how he had so many failed escape attempts: that does bring some realism (unlike that other Bond film when he took on the entire North Korean army singlehanded). I do not remember the girls AT ALL. One was named Pussy, oh haha. One was painted in gold, ok... One screws everything up. The point i'm making is that they all are so similar to each other and have almost no personality that I just don't care for them. Where this movie shines is in its villains; Goldfinger and Oddjob. Gold is very intelligent but his temper and brutality makes him dangerously unpredictable. Oddjob's muteness and indestructibility makes him mysterious and really intimidating. Overall this film feels more like a superhero story than a spy movie, with Bond basically playing the role of Batman but with fewer bat-weapons. I don't know why this film is so famous though, I think it's overrated, at least by today's standards. Still good, but definitely not the Citizen Kane of action, or even spy movies.\"},\n",

       "   'review': '  It took until the third installment of the Ian Fleming-based James Bond spy movie franchise for its identity to crystallize. Following on the successful heels of Dr. No and From Russia with Love- both directed by Terence Young, Sean Connery\\'s early mentor for the urbane leading role - Goldfinger marked a significant upgrade in production values that would make everything about the franchise iconic.Budgeted at more than the cost of the first two films combined, Goldfinger launched the ritual of beginning each subsequent Bond film with a stand-alone mission sequence for the fictional British MI6 agent, known by his code number 007, to show off his stuff. Other customs follow. An assignment meeting with British Secret Service head M allows for the otherwise autonomous Mr. Bond to have his feathers clipped while being informed of his latest mission. A little office flirtation with M\\'s secretary Ms. Moneypenny segues into a meeting with resident gadget master Q, who gets Bond up to speed on the state-of-the-art devices that the audience can expect to see employed throughout the movie. From here on, female characters would be sexier and more dangerous, yet also more likely to die. Exotic set pieces would be epic in scale. The series\\' signature nuanced tone, straddling dualities such as dry humor and outrageous danger, would be more pronounced.Goldfinger is practically the template for the modern action blockbuster, yet still it\\'s impossible to hate. In fact, it\\'s deucedly hard not to love, simply because everything it does, it does so much better than its inheritors. A handful of other Bond flicks qualify as more \"serious\" suspense, and one (Skyfall) even borders on flawless. But Goldfinger will always be the best, for the same reason the Beatles will always be the best rock act and Peanuts will always be the best American comic strip: It\\'s a phenomenon that defines its category.'},\n",

       "   'review': '  The third Bond film has been hailed by many critics as the Bondiest one of all, therefore ultimately the best in the series. Unfortunately, they\\'re wrong, and the movie is among the dullest of the Sean Connery 007s. Why, you may ask? So many reasons; but before we get to that, I\\'ll roughly sketch out the plot. After a pre-intro credit sequence (the sequence being a particularly memorable highlight in the film), Bond finds himself in Miami spying on a gold dealer named Goldfinger, a brilliant criminal mastermind, and the movie\\'s chief antagonist. Bond finds Goldfinger poolside at a posh hotel where he\\'s inexplicably cheating at gin rummy with the help of a telephoto lens wielding assistant (did I mention it\\'s a sexy girl?) in a nearby hotel room who is feeding him his opponents cards via radio earpiece. Bond goes upstairs, and sexes her over to his side, and then is knocked out by Korean enforcer, and cheapest character in Goldeneye deathmatch, Oddjob. When he wakes up, the girl he sexed earlier is dead and covered in gold paint. Oops.The film then transports Bond to merry ol\\' England, where he beats him at golf, then scenic Switzerland, where he discovers one of Goldfinger\\'s evil plans, then on a private plane flown by Pussy Galore, the first of many ridiculously named Bond girls, and then finally to ... uh... rural Kentucky. Yeah. It\\'s here that 007 learns the true nature of Goldfinger\\'s devious plan: detonating an atomic device in Fort Knox, irradiating the US gold supply, and increasing his personal net worth in doing so. Now let\\'s get to the meat of why this movie is dull as hell when it comes to Bond films. First, there\\'s an unnecessary long golf match, which is supposed to show how cunning Bond is, but was much more effective in the novel than it is on screen. Secondly, after being put up against villains like Dr. No, Donald \"Red\" Grant, and the mysterious Number 1, being put up against an overweight ginger obsessed with Gold and his stocky Korean stereotype is a bit over the line. The characters in general are simultaneously unbelievable and kitschy, but the plot attempts to take itself seriously, creating a continual contradiction that leaves the audience wondering if they should be laughing, or held in suspense. This is visually supplemented by moments where footage of on-location filming is intercut with clearly green screened shots where there is absolutely no fathomable rationale for it to be occurring.  A good example of this is Goldfinger\\'s harebrained scheme for getting his atomic device into Fort Knox: having Pussy Galore fly above the compound with five planes and release a nerve gas over the area killing all the guards, completely ignoring the fact that this wouldn\\'t affect anyone inside a building, the amount of dispersion that would occur in the attempt, the concept of gas masks, and the difficult to factor conditions like wind, humidity and precipitation. The way that Bond outwits Goldfinger\\'s scheme is even more ridiculous and puts the movie into the over-the-top camp department of cinema, which is absurd and, considering it\\'s the final act of the film, feels almost intellectually offensive to the viewer.  But if you can suspend your disbelief throughout all of that, you still have to wonder how a brilliant criminal mastermind like Goldfinger is actually a bumbling con artist that can\\'t beat Bond in even the simplest of attempts. It makes you really start to question how he got to be so powerful in the first place, and how nearly every female agent he has in his employ is so quick to turn on him when a dashing British agent comes along offering nothing but a one night stand in exchange to their presumably high-salary position. Nearly half of the film takes place in Kentucky, since this is where the meat and potatoes of the plot is taking place, and boy, oh boy, is it a fucking snore. Rather than cavorting in high class hotels, high roller casinos, and high alcohol bars, Bond has to stay on a ranch in rural southern America not doing much of anything. There is possibly no place in the entire franchise where the character is more out of his element, and it clashes so severely with the mythos that you\\'re left simultaneously scratching your head and wondering when it will all just end. TL;DR - 5/10 Inconsistent, dull, intellectually bankrupt. Goldfinger has good moments, but they\\'re peppered into a movie that is ultimately a chore to get through. Unlike previous installments in the series, which had lower budgets, this movie relies on hat tips to fans and doesn\\'t attempt to create a movie that stands well on its own two feet. Much of this movie\\'s success has to be based on nostalgia, and the established status that it already has, but if you go back to watch it now, grab an energy drink, cause it\\'s a total slog.'},\n",

It solidifies the successful formula and acts as the foundation that carries the series through the next fifty years. The Golfinger character is an iconic greedy villain with a bold plan to spike the cost of gold by blowing up Fort Knox. His henchman, Odd Job, has super strength and provides the needed physical opposition to complement such a thinking villain. Brining Bond to the United States for this adventure was a brilliant marketing move that greatly expanded the fan base of the franchise. Under Guy Hamilton's direction, this movie is a spectacle. It is more expensive and flexes a bigger in concept than the previous two movies. With stimulating global locations and sleek sexy interior set designs, this movie looks fantastic. There is incredible creativity with an abundance of forward-thinking gadgetry in this movie. Q's gadgets are one of the most important aspects differentiating Bond from other action movies. Some of the technology may seem dated, but if you remind yourself that it is set in 1964, you will appreciate the innovation that captivated audiences at the time. Sean Connery is in his peak here. He is funny, smart, charming, and convincingly tough with the action and fighting. Connery's physical movements, fashion, facial expressions, and attitude become a part of the character. It even influenced the way Ian Flemming's novels. All subsequent actors to play the role will face the comparison to Connery's performance in this movie. Female supporting roles played by Honor Blackman, Shirley Eaton, and Tania Mallet are memorable as well.

Great theme song by Shirley Bassey, contains some of the most memorable scenes of the franchise (Do you expect me to talk?), fantastic gadgets, and Bond has some truly funny one-liners. The whole affair really feels like a 60's pulp-thrill comic book brought to vivid life, and I mean that in the best sense possible. However, with all these elements that surely make Goldfinger an entertaining flick, why is it I don't LOVE this entry as much as everybody else does? I think it comes down to two critical things:1. Despite her outrageously hilarious name, I find Pussy Galore to be the most over-hyped Bond girl of all time. Outside of her name, I just find her to be a bland, unremarkable character and don't get me started on the infamous barn scene.2. The second act, in which Bond is a prisoner of the title villain, is a bit too slow-paced and nearly grinds the whole affair to a dead halt. The fact that the whole second-half of the movie takes place in America doesn't help matters (I find pretty much all the Bond movies that take place in America to be boring)Don't misunderstand, I do enjoy this movie and I do appreciate it's importance to the franchise, but it doesn't even break my personal top ten Bond entries.

       "   'review': '  Goldfinger, Great MoviesGoldfinger could best be described as the quintessential, definitive Bond film, the first of the series to set the necessities of the entire saga in motion. It is also the best of the Bond movies, arguably the most suave and sophisticated, far superior to the Roger Moore era and those who followed in Connery\\'s footsteps. It is the Bond ultimatum, so to speak. Goldfinger was the first of the iconic legacy to feature Q (Desmond Llewelyn) as a recurring comic relief figure. (He was introduced in From Russia with Love, the second film in the series, where he was credited as Major Boothroyd, and given little screen time.) It was also the first to truly setup the suave nature of 007, the tongue-in-cheek humor (absent in the first movie, Dr. No), the far-fetched gadgetry (including fast cars, this one being an Aston-Martin) and, arguably, the first of the series to feature the famous line, \"Bond, James Bond,\" as a 007 catchphrase, versus a mere line of dialogue. When Bond storms out onto the patio of the motel room, the camera zooms in towards his face, the 007 theme song roars through the speakers, and he says his motto with cool confidence. It\\'s Bond, baby. Both of Goldfinger\\'s predecessors were darker, more serious motion pictures -- more in-tune with the writing of Fleming versus the suaveness to later be salvaged from the series with the third installment. Although Dr. No was a terrific movie, and although From Russia with Love is exciting, Goldfinger beats them both. It features the best (and most famous) Bond villain to ever grace the screen, constantly spoofed in countless productions: Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), the target of Austin Powers in Goldmember and, according to IMDb, referenced and spoofed in well over 100 other productions. There isn\\'t much of a plot, really. Goldfinger plans to rob Fort Knox and become the richest man in the world. Bond finds out and tries to put a stop to his mission. What entices us, and what makes the film so entertaining despite the absurdity, is its leniency towards itself. It doesn\\'t mind being silly because the entertainment value far outweighs any flaws. Plus, it has some of the most memorable scenes in history, and arguably the best Villain Explanation Scene to ever be recorded. \"Do you expect me to talk, Goldfinger?\" Bond (Sean Connery) asks as a laser beam slowly makes its way towards his groin. \"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\" he says with mock ridicule, before walking away. The following shots is one of the only sequences in James Bond history where the iconic character actually seems fairly worried that fate may be playing a deadly hand. Released in 1964, fifty years later it stands as one of the most risqu� (C) Bond films to date. Especially for its time, there is brief nudity during the opening credits, sexual scenes, constant innuendo (including a Bond girl named \"Pussy Galore,\" played by Honor Blackman) and implications of lesbianism. Galore\\'s sexual orientation is not delved into as deeply and explicitly as it may be dealt with in today\\'s day and age, but the inclusion exists. Bond struggles verbally with Galore, trying to woo and seduce her, and she subtly implies from their very first meeting that she will not be seduced, claiming it is impossible for Bond to get very far with her, thereby insinuating that she is, in fact, a lesbian. According to the director of the film, Guy Hamilton, the entire situation is given much more emphasis in the novel by Ian Fleming, but it was simply too foul a subject for audiences back in 1964. Surprisingly, the verbal exchanges and implications behind the subject matter are much more effective. All of the actors in Goldfinger are, at the very least, very good. But of course, it is really Sean Connery who demands our utmost attention and respect, for it is Connery whose inhumanly strong screen presence launched Bond into the heights of Movie Legend. There is a sort of iconic legacy surrounding the entire Bond franchise that will probably never die. Different action heroes come and go, and nowadays Rambo looks criminally out of date, but Bond, in his black-and-white tuxedo, with all his suave sophistication, will never grow old, because he is a timeless hero who is comprised of all the greatest heroic attributes to ever be assembled, and although his style and looks may grow weary amid the changing ages, his character will remain the ultimate hero, and I very much doubt that we will ever live to see a day when Bond becomes outdated.'},\n",

       "   'review': '  Sir Sean Connery will always be the quintessential Bond and this is one his best films as 007. The plot involves a sinister amoral tycoon Auric Goldfinger, played with great panache by German actor Gert Frobe who brings a considerable amount class and menace to the title role. Goldfinger plans to irradiated the gold reserves of the United States by exploding a small nuclear device inside Fort Knox and obliterating the world economy as well as corning the gold market. Connery is in top form and is the epitome of cool in his portrayal of Bond, tough, charismatic and ultra-suave, as Goldfinger\\'s pilot and Bond\\'s sexy foil the wonderfully named Pussy Galore is one of the all time best Bond girls, Honor Blackman plays the judo skilled no nonsense woman with real spirit and intelligence. Goldfinger\\'s bodyguard/assassin Oddjob is played memorably by Hawaiian wrestler Harold Sakata, he is mute nearly invulnerable with an evil grin and a lethal steel razor edged bowler hat that when toss could cut the head of a marble statue. It should be mentioned that this film featured the debut of the beloved \"Q,\" wonderfully played by the late Desmond Llewellyn, the inventor of Bond\\'s spy hardware and Bond\\'s first spy gadget; the Aston Martin, a sports car laden with headlight machine guns, smokescreen, oil slick, bulletproof shield and a passenger side ejector seat. Marvelous direction by Guy Hamilton, with an outstanding production design by Ken Adam, and a brilliant score by the late great John Barry. Goldfinger set records at the time as the fastest grossing film in history, making back it\\'s $3,000,000 production cost in just two weeks in only 67 screens. There is an unforgettable title song that gave this franchise it\\'s first worldwide No.1 hit song, it was sung by the incomparable Shirley Bassey. This film is one of the most enjoyable of all the Bond films and richly deserves it\\'s classic status. Highly Recommended.'},\n",

       "   'review': '  The gold-plated edition of early Bond, this perfectly shaken martini of devastating wit, action, and intrigue also introduces some lasting finishing touches to the franchise all of its own. Ironically, it bares noting from the get-go that this was the first 007 flick to use the line \"A martini...shaken, not stirred\" as a calling card for the suavest and deadliest of superspies. Dr. No and From Russia with Love established the brand but Goldfinger put all of the elements to their most brilliant effect and gives all future 4-Star Bond chapters a run for their Moneypenny. In this, the quintessential 007 film, James Bond (Connery) uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve while investigating a gold magnate\\'s (Gert Frobe) smuggling empire. Though his spyware started a slippery slope into camp from this film on (inflating dart in Live and Let Die; the invisible car in Die Another Day), the geeky gadgets keep up the cheeky cheer in this outing, Bond\\'s seagull-hat disguise, Oddjob\\'s (himself, one of the great series henchmen) steel-rimmed hat, and Goldfinger\\'s laser among the best. Also, Q\\'s laboratory first gets walked through, the Aston Martin first gets driven, and a pre-title action sequence first kicks off a new spy adventure (Robert Shaw choking out a foot solider wearing a Bond mask in From Russia with Love just doesn\\'t count). Of all of the early films and their lasting effect on pop culture, Goldfinger uses all of the tricks in Bond\\'s exploding briefcase to the most well-rounded heights. The tone, humor, casting, and action sequences fire on all cylinders in a perfect full circle of crazy cool entertainment. Future Bond movies would boast better examples of each of these elements but the 3rd film uses them consistently well and its riff-worthiness in the Internet age only speaks volumes as to its longevity and ability to kill audiences. Bottom line: Midas Touche'},\n",

       "   'review': \"  If you are the person that loves the fun in Bond, the camp and the outlandish, and why should you? Then this is the one that started it all. Yes Bond may have already firmly established himself in 2 previous outings but for some Goldfinger is the quintessential Bond movie and although I believe it to be a brilliant piece of cinema, for me it has never, even having watched it many times through my life, been what everyone hypes it up to be. Is that to say its bad, of course not. Goldfinger goes bold, it goes large, it gets the ball rolling thick and fast. While Bond is on, what he believe to be, holiday to Miami, he bumps into his old friend Felix Lieter, who asks him to observe a potential threat to national security Auric Goldfinger, soon however Bond finds himself biting off more than he can chew, as people around him start dying and he himself soon falls victim to Goldfingers grand plot. Goldfinger starts us off with some completely redundant mission, that never feels important or interesting, more convieniant and from then on minor gripes just continue throughout. I'll get the positive out of the way, Goldfinger is the first Bond movie to have a Bond theme, sung blisteringly by Shirley Bassie, it has turned the action, for that decade, up to 11 and has really upped the comedy value. Bond is now lighter than before with jokes aplenty, some brilliant, some not so much and completely hilarious over the top villain shenanigans. Bond himself is utterly fantastic, its clear as day now that Connery is relishing in every moment he gets to be Bond and he chews the screen up every chance he gets. The film also includes some wonderfully quirky characters, in the form of Pussy Galour, yes you read that right and Oddjob, they are iconic and extremely memorable. What the film does have, however is just everything that became preposterous about the franchise. A villain who although, always seems to be miles ahead of Bond, still decides to keep him alive and a decoration to his plan because... Well, just because. Goldfinger explains his operation to Bond, which proves to be detrimental as one might expect, in what the franchise is now ripped to shreds for, the old tell the good guy the plot before killing him, in such a way that he will escape. What adds more insult to injury is that Bond vanishes for a large chunk of this movie, deciding to pull the focus onto Goldfinger, a character who is so well written but so poorly acted by Gert Frobe. Goldfinger feels like a comedy bad guy and it sadly diffuses any tension that should be there, especially when Bond is being duped at every turn. Luckily the threat comes in the shape of Oddjob, if not emotionally but physically. I also have a huge gripe with the over abundance of screen work done on this film. There are huge segments where its so frighteningly clear that actors are having a conversation, in a studio, in front of a screen. I can excuse this during a car chase, I cant when you background is a group of people sun bathing, it cannot be that hard to achieve, you must have filmed it at some point, why not film the entire scene there instead. Maybe its down to time but its seriously noticable and hilariously criminal. The film does survive however and as the entity it is, is a hugely fun and bombastic experience, its not perfect and it lacks the tension that the first 2 films have. Although it is a welcome change to have more memorable characters and set pieces and having Bond go bold once in a while is not a bad thing, you cant help but feel this film opened up a huge can of worms. Essential yes, hugely overrated, hell yes.\"},\n",

Sean Connery returns in the third James Bond film this time going after a man named Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe). Goldfinger has a master plan to rob the US Gold Deposits at Fort Knox and it's up to 007 and his own cunningness to save the day. The movie is still dated compared to today's standards and some may find it cheesy with its numerous quips and puns, but man is it still an entertaining film. The film is less than two hours long and it may come off as a bit of a slow down in pacing half way through the film, but for me what works is Goldfinger himself. We have a villain that isn't like a typical villain. Yes, he eventually is taken down, but he is ruthless and is actually very intelligent. Why explain your master plan to your arch nemesis when you can just shoot a laser at him. Genius stuff. Overall, a great 007 film to check out!\"},\n",

Finally technical wise, it feels very well done as aproduction and although some films around the time has shabby and dimlit sets, Bond's sets are great big ones and even one of the morehumble Bond's.The film isn't without criticism, it has it's parts where it drags justa little, but to be fair to the film the good parts basically make upfor the parts where it maybe slightly misses the mark. I also felt thestory is kind of ridiculous and that although most critics and audiencealike like the film, many I feel would have to admit that the story Iskind of far fetched for even a Bond Movie, can't damn it for it's wackyideas though.Bond fans should fall in love with this and probably already are withstereotypical Bond all the way through this, and with ease. Those whoenjoy the three genres Bond is, Action, Adventure and Crime will notdispleased by this as it also represents them in a good way with thevillain being a good criminal, Bond fights a lot and with that he goesto a lot of different places also.I give this a low 8/10 meaning it is safely very good, I will disagree withthose who think it is a GREAT film but nevertheless I can see why theyfeel that way about this. Connery really brings Bond to life here andwith thrill and a suave personality that just makes you want to seethem all, by far this is Connerys best and wouldn't be surprised if youthought this was THE best Bond film of the entire film series.\"},\n",

Add the first Shirley Bassey theme song and some exciting action sequences and the result is an explosive cocktail. Goldfinger is by far my favorite bond film that I have seen. The main song in this movie \"Goldfinger\" got stuck in my head while watching the whole film. The two main villains in the movie Odd Job and Goldfinger himself was two remember-able and in my opinion, the best villains in a movie. Odd Job to me was like bane, he can break you with a little touch of hands just like that. Goldfinger has a villain was interesting and something about makes you think \"what goes threw that mans head\". Sean Connery will always be bond, in my heart and soul.'},\n",

Where Dr. No and From Russia With Love were deathly serious, concentrating heavily on suspense, Goldfinger is far less afraid to kick back and have a little fun when the opportunity arises. There's definitely a healthy dose of the 1960s at play here, from the fashions on display to the attitudes of those wearing them, but in almost every single instance that results in a stronger, more vibrant cast. Despite their appallingly silly names, Oddjob, Pussy Galore and even Goldfinger himself are thoroughly deep, interesting, remarkable characters with a lot going on beneath the surface. The exploration of each villain's unique nooks and crannies, paired with an intensely curvy, unpredictable plot and the unmistakable presence of Bond himself, provides more fuel than any film could reasonably require. Quick in wit and in pace, it covers a lot of ground with admirable efficiency, leaves us with two fistfuls of memorable moments, and raises the stakes to staggering heights.

This film features the famous Aston Martin with machine guns, ejector seat and bullet proof glass, as well as stellar performances from Sean Connery, Honor Blackman and Gert Frobe as Goldfinger.  What I wasn\\'t expecting was the in-your-face misogyny of this film. In one particularly offensive scene, Bond meets with his American colleague at a high end Miami resort, dismissing his latest sexual conquest with a smack on the backside, telling her there will be \"man talk\" that she could surely not grasp.  Then there\\'s Pussy Galore, a name lampooned by Mike Myers as Ivana Humpalot and Alotta Fagina in the Austin Powers films. I don\\'t think film viewers would appreciate a male bond villain named Huge Cock or Big Dick, so I\\'m left dumbfounded by this naming stupidity, which carries on with future films such as Octopussy. This is where most Bond films lose my support. There\\'s tongue-in-cheek sexual humour, which I understand, but what I see in Goldfinger is the blatant on screen objectification of women. For example, Pussy Galore is a committed villain, and business partner to Goldfinger - until having sex (once) with Bond. Apparently, \\'uncloaking his dagger\\' changed Pussy Galore into an honest woman.'},\n",

Although there are still a lot that would instead name its follow-up, \\'Goldfinger\\'. I consider myself part of this group, because even when I was just a little boy, and only really liked James Bond because it was \"in\" to like him, I always felt that \\'Goldfinger\\' had something else which was special. Being now a knowledgeable enthusiast towards the entire franchise, I know that this one was really the first to contain both conflicting elements of an engaging thriller, and a camp comic-strip of silly stunts, sarky catchphrases, and dumb but beautiful girls who were still of an era when shooing away a woman, saying \"man talk\", and spanking her, would not have gotten you a broken nose. Megalomaniacs were still convincing villains, and talking your nemesis to death instead of just shooting him was still considered an appropriate practice - but hey, I still think that this film was one of the most compelling of all the Bond films. Not only is the Fort Knox plan surprisingly swallowable, but the pacing between action sequences is just as exciting as the rest.

       "   'review': '  The opening credits designed by Brownjohn with scenes from the film projected on a gold painted girl are some of the best. The theme song as sung by Shirley Bassey is also one of the best. This third Bond spy flick was Guy Hamilton\\'s first time directing for the franchise out of four entries. The cinematography by Ted Moore and production design by Ken Adam are tops. Bond has some of the most fun gadgets in this one. The fights are thrilling. The tongue-in-cheek humor is supreme. I don\\'t agree with Bond\\'s sexist treatment of women. The character and his surroundings are such a fantasy. In Goldfinger, maybe more than in any other James Bond film, the hero is concerned with proving his masculinity. Goldfinger\\'s super-laser threatens his manhood and he later forces himself on Pussy. There are only three locations this time. We start in Miami Beach where Bond meets CIA counterpart Felix Leiter. This second portrayal of the American secret agent is played by Cec Linder. Bond begins observing criminal Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Frobe, but voiced by Michael Collins). After a quick meeting with M (Lee), a bit of mutual teasing with Moneypenny (Maxwell), and a session with Q (Llewelyn), Bond has a plan and is off to Geneva. Bond and Goldfinger golf. Hawaiian wrestling champion Harold Sakata is Goldfinger\\'s mute and deadly South Korean caddie, chauffeur, and all around manservant, Oddjob. A little later Bond uncovers part of Goldfinger\\'s scheme when he spies him talking to Mr. Ling (Kwouk) at a factory. During these two missions Bond gets close to two Masterson sisters, Jill and Tilly (Eaton and Mallet), but Oddjob proves lethal to both. Kisch (Mellinger) is another Goldfinger henchman whose face becomes familiar. Finally Bond meets Pussy Galore, played by gorgeous judo trained Honor Blackman. Pussy tells him, \"You can turn off the charm. I\\'m immune.\" She and her group of lady pilots are part of Goldfinger\\'s master plan. Pussy brings Bond to Goldfinger\\'s stud ranch in Kentucky. Goldfinger\\'s lair in the bluegrass state is surprisingly cool. Bond has to be careful how he plays his figurative cards to stay a step ahead of the villain. The criminal plot is not to rob Fort Knox, but to radioactively contaminate all the gold. There are some ridiculous scenes with the U.S. troops stationed near the gold reserve, but most of the effects are exciting. Goldfinger has more surprises up his sleeve than you might expect and Bond has his work cut out for him.'},\n",

In particular there are 2 still frames that would become as famous as anything that had come before: a girl painted gold, and a giant laser threatening to slice Bond in half. There isn\\'t a ton of new character development for the leads in this film, they stick with the well-known characterizations from the first 2. The big difference here is that everything is cranked up to be bigger and bolder. In fact I heard that this film had a budget larger than Dr. No and From Russia with Love combined. I\\'m not sure whether that\\'s a good thing, because bigger isn\\'t always better.Connery is still great, although he seems to be too tightly embracing the humor here. There are so many moments should be serious and intense, yet Connery almost seems to be chuckling under his breath at the absurdity of it all. Mercifully they opted for English-speaking Bond girls here, so they avoided the annoyance of rough dubbing. Or did they? No, now they decide to cast a German as their villain, so he must be dubbed and my annoyance continues. Thankfully Oddjob remains silent so there is no concern about dubbing there. The cast is good, aside from that minor quibble. It helps that the person providing the voice for Goldfinger is so emotive. Despite my upcoming complaint about the laser scene, Goldfinger\\'s delivery of the line \"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\" is one of the best by any Bond villain in history.My beef with this chapter of Bond is the fact that it is here they begin to succumb to the unrealistic. In the first 2 films some unlikely yet plausible things happen, but in Goldfinger we are basically asked to enter the realm of the fantastical. Car ejector seats, lasers to kill instead of a simple shot to the head, a razor-sharp hat that can slice marble, it all just extends my suspension of disbelief to its breaking point. The villains are seemingly morons now, \"Hey, he ducked his head down, I better go in that cell to see where he went.\" Bond seems to have a magical power in his *ahem* lips to reform women and turn them to his side. I like my heroes doing the improbable to win the day, but not the impossible. While Goldfinger is indeed a fun film, it falls short for me because it pushed the boundaries too far.'},\n",

Bond has to go through his most intense situations yet, such as an encounter with Goldfinger\\'s pilot Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), witnessing a woman covered in gold paint, and avoiding a deadly laser.  Other stars in this film include Bernard Lee returning as M, Lois Maxwell returning as Moneypenny, Desmond Llewellyn returning as Q, Cec Linder appearing this time as CIA agent Felix Leiter, and Harold Sakata starring as Oddjobs, Goldfinger\\'s henchman with a deadly boulder hat.  Without a doubt, this is Connery\\'s best outing as Bond, in my opinion. After taking a step backwards with From Russia With Love, Goldfinger showcases Bond as we all know him. It also shows Bond using his most famous line for the first time- \"A martini. Shaken not stirred.\", and features 007 using more gadgets, in this film, we see an Ashton Martin with machine guns, and a mini tracker placed inside a person\\'s shoe.  The action is an upgrade over From Russia With Love, and Goldfinger is one of Bond\\'s best villains. Who could forget his line \"No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!\"? It\\'s classic. Pussy Galore is a well-made character, and is probably one of the best Bond girls.  Many of the action sequences are awesome, from the raid at Fort Knox, the opening pre-credits scene involving a bomb blast at a chemical plant, and Bond in action with his Ashton Martin.  With Goldfinger, 007 became a household name and became a legendary classic. For those who haven\\'t seen it, you\\'re in for a treat.  The end of my review for Goldfinger.

He starts by starting a relationship with one of his employees, Jill. But when Goldfinger find out, he has her killed by having his assistant Oddjob cover her in paint which kills her by \\'epidermal suffocation\\'. Later Bond and the British Intelligence learn that his true plan is to smuggle gold internationally, so Bond has to find out how and - you guessed it - stop him.This is another great film of James Bond. While it stops focusing on SPECTRE, it give us a new and rather unique villain and an also interesting sidekick. Oddjob especially I\\'ve more or less have been familiar with before because of the video game Nightfire where I learned about his special weapon, but apparently during the end of this movie, he ended up giving us a little more of what makes him quite the person for Bond to go up against. As for Goldfinger himself, he has especially been ranked # 49 in AFI\\'s 100 Heroes and Villains list. And while I\\'m not totally sure I understand why he\\'s such a great villain, especially considering what his master plan more or less turned out to be, I still can tell what makes him so popular. Despite whatever issues I have with his plan, it was still rather unique for someone whole has a love for gold and what he intends to do with it. Though honestly I would\\'ve liked to have seen more of him having Oddjob killing people with gold paint. I just thought that was fairly creative and I wished that I saw more of that. As for everything else, the story and action were very well done and the story especially seemed to have a big impact on the series as a whole. How that\\'s the case, I\"m not completely sure, but obviously that\\'s something that I\\'ll find out about as I go further into these films. Also this is the film where we are given that laser scene. In other words, if you are wondering how so many TV shows especially have been making a big cliche out of a villain trying to dispose of a secret agent or other kind of hero by strapping them to a table and firing a laser that\\'s working its way trying to kill the hero, this is the film that started it all. Other impacts this film made are the classic line \"A martini shaken not stirred\" (which I think was more or less already said in the first movie by Dr. No, but I guess the way Bond said it worked well enough to make it a thing) and also the song Goldfinger which has become a very memorable song that they even played in the last Academy Awards.And that\\'s y review for Goldfinger. It have us very memorable villains, great action and story, and a classical quote and song that makes it one of the best Bond film to apparently a lot of people.'},\n",

       "   'review': '  This is talked about as the best Bond film, but I thought it lacked a lot. It had all the makings to be a great film, but left too much on the table and just left me thinking what could have been.Yes, Connery is solid here, but the story also starts to get a bit cheesy from the previous two. Cars exploding before the even crash for example. When Bond seduces a girl, they literally role around in hay. Yuck yuck.But I felt the bad guy was more a mastermind than really evil. Odd Job was fun, but seemed to not do much in the mid section there.The woman were a huge problem too. They were all gorgeous for sure, but their development was awful. The sisters are both in and out of the film before you can even blink, and Pussy Galore is basically a hired female thug, but we never really understand her motivations in the end.The final plane stuff was pretty awful too...when the plane is flying you can see the wires for one. Awful.Theme song is great. A five star movie was there, they just needed to polish a few things up.'},\n",

       "   'review': '  This is when James Bond really became James Bond. When we think of 007 we think of cars with cool gadgets, and cheesy villains. Sean Connery was the best Bond after Daniel Craig and this was the best film he did, and the best in the whole series after Skyfall, and Casino Royale. The first two in the series Dr. No, and From Russia With Love were great, but not as great as this, because they were slower, and they didn\\'t have all the gadgets that make the stereotypical 007 film that we love. They had them, but not as much as this film did. All the James Bond films are cheesy, but some of them are too cheesy. This one was cheesy enough for it to be funny and entertaining, but not so much that the film couldn\\'t be taken seriously at all. That is why this is my favorite of the old ones. What is good about Sean Connery is that he is like the Cary Grant of the 60\\'s in the Bond films. He sounds like him and was similar in personality to him. He had the same leading man presence that Grant had too. Which was perfect for a 60\\'s Bond film.James Bond (Sean Connery) is ordered by his superior M to go to Miami Beach to observe Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fr�be), a bullion dealer that is staying at the same hotel. After bond catches Goldfinger cheating at gin rummy, and stops him he consummates the relationship with the employee he used to blackmail Goldfinger into losing. He is knocked out by Goldfingers servant Oddjob (Harold Sakata)he wakes up and finds her dead covered in gold paint. After he learns what Goldfinger\\'s true mission is he arranges to meet Goldfinger and play golf with him. He beats Goldfinger, and then follows him to Switzerland determined to find out how he smuggles Gold internationally.This film gets parodied a lot in Austin Powers films. OddJob\\'s famous thing in this film is that he throws his hat and it breaks a statue. In the first Austin Powers there is a guy who throws a shoe. The 3rd Austin Powers film was called \"Goldmember\" which was a parody to the title of this film. The Bond films have had a huge effect on the film industry, and the fact that they get parodied so often shows that. This film is one of the most important films in the series, and it is one of the greatest films of all time. It is the one Bond film in the book \"1001 movies you must see before you die.\"This is a great movie that is fun, funny, and cheasy. You can make fun of it without ruining it, which makes Bond films so special. Also because this is only the third film it was still original and new. After a while it got ruined because it became the same thing over and over again. I liked this one because it felt so original at first. The other Bond films were mostly decent, but they weren\\'t as good until Daniel Craig came around and reinvented 007 and made it better. This is a great classic overall.'},\n",

       "   'review': '  For a lot of people especially back in the 60s \"Goldfinger\" was the Bond film that officially kick started the Bond phenomenon worldwide and made Sean Connery a household name as James Bond. This was the Bond film that had it all: countless beautiful and gorgeous women, stunning action set pieces and gadgets including the famous and iconic Aston Martin DB5, a great and quotable villain (Bond:\"Do you expect me to talk?\" Goldfinger:\"No Mr. Bond, I expect you to DIE.\") along with a memorable henchman Oddjob, and an outlandish scheme thats quite ingenious. Goldfinger set the standard for all other Bond films that followed afterwords from the opening teaser before the titles that set up the action, to the title sequence with the title song for the movie to the main plot and so on and so forth. Sean Connery is James Bond at his peak with his cool suave, witty ladysman personality and cunning to get out of a tough situation.(Hint. one of the iconic scenes in the movie where Bond is captured. And his most cool moment(Jill:\"Who are you? Bond:\"Bond. James Bond.\" cue Bond theme). Shirley Eaton as Jill is memorable for being hot for five minutes and then getting killed off by skin suffocation of gold paint in one of the most memorable scenes from the movie. Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore(the 60s really were an innocent time) has the honor of being the oldest and most attractive Bond girl at the time at the age of 37 and for having good chemistry with Sean Connery. German actor Gert Frobe(dubbed by Michael Collins) who plays Goldfinger is one of the best villains outside of SPECTRE in the Sean Connery era. (He\\'s rich, cheats at cards and golf, kills his girlfriend because she let him lose at cards and tries to blow up Fort Knox to make himself even richer.) His henchman played by Olympic weightlifter and wrestler Harold Sakata is very memorable as Oddjob who never speaks but has an ominous presence and only uses his hat as a weapon. Felix Leiter returns but is now played by Cec Linder. Other cast members return also including Desmond Llewelyn as Q who gets a memorable line and gadgets to introduce to 007(James Bond), which would happen regularly in every Bond movie afterwords.Guy Hamilton\\'s take on 007 is very tongue-in-cheek which tries to balance action and comedy but works perfectly and would become a staple of the series. \"Goldfinger\" is one of the most memorable, often quoted and just downright entertaining and quintessential movies of the series solidifying James Bond as a pop cultural phenomenon.'},\n",

This is a major turning point in the Bond series in that the tone shifted from that of a cold war thriller, to that of a gadget laden and extravagant action adventure. Goldfinger himself is a great villain with the ultimate obligatory henchman, Oddjob. The film is well paced and has great action set pieces. Bond is still using mostly his wits here, but Q-branch has supplied him with his most extensive range of gadgets yet, along with one of cinema's greatest vehicles. Unfortunately, nearly all the work is done for Bond here. Fortunately, it's still very exciting nonetheless. All the great quips and one liners come into play here as well. There are three excellent Bond girls in Jill Masterson, Tilly Masterson, and the name that became the butt of every Bond girl joke, Pussy Galore.
